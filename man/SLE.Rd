\arguments{
\item{expr}{A expression dataframe with gene rows and sample columns.}

\item{state}{A time-series dataframe with two columns, the first is the sample names and the second is the group or time point information.}

\item{state.levels}{A vector for state sequence.}

\item{cor.method}{specifies the method for correlation analysis.}

\item{p.adjust.method}{correction method, a character string. Can be abbreviated. c("holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none")}

\item{ppi}{Protein-protein interaction network; background network.}

\item{min.combined.score}{Minimum combined score for determining protein-protein interaction.}

\item{min.first.neighbor.size}{Minimum size of first order genes of a specific center gene.}

\item{percent}{Whether to use Percent to determine the number of DNB genes.}

\item{top.n}{Only Percent = F takes effect. Center genes with top (number) DNB score were defined as DNB genes.}

\item{top.p}{Only Percent = T takes effect. Center genes with top (percent) DNB score were defined as DNB genes.}

\item{nCores}{The number of cores will be used.}
